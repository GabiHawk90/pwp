<h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>what I am going to accomplish with this PWP is proving to myself and others that I am a web developer and I can do the work. <br> I hope to bring more            business to my friend in the baking industry, and in turn build my portfolio.</p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The audience I am hoping to attract will be the farmers market people and local organic lovers, who given the current circumstances do not have <br> a        market to safely go to.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To acquire part time work</li>
    <li>To increase business for my client</li>
    <li>To attract freelance clients</li>
    <li>To start and grow my portfolio</li>
    <li>To establish a social media presence</li>
</ul>
