    <h3>User Story</h3>
<p> Berkley is a Barista to pay his bills and work on his true passion, Djing. Berkley is not happy about the early hours but he does enjoy going to the growers         market for fresh baked goodies and vegetables on the weekends. Berkley also enjoys having nights off so he can dj small art openings in the downtown area.        Since everything has mostly closed, Berkley doesnt get to go out much but he has found sanctuary at home on the internet.
